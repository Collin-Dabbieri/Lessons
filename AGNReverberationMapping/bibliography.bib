	abstract = {We present the results from a detailed analysis of photometric and spectrophotometric data on five Seyfert 1 galaxies observed as a part of a recent reverberation mapping program. The data were collected at several observatories over a 140 day span beginning in 2010 August and ending in 2011 January. We obtained high sampling-rate light curves for Mrk 335, Mrk 1501, 3C 120, Mrk 6, and PG 2130+099, from which we have measured the time lag between variations in the 5100 Å continuum and the Hβ broad emission line. We then used these measurements to calculate the mass of the supermassive black hole at the center of each of these galaxies. Our new measurements substantially improve previous measurements of M
            BH and the size of the broad line-emitting region for four sources and add a measurement for one new object. Our new measurements are consistent with photoionization physics regulating the location of the broad line region in active galactic nuclei.}

	abstract = {We derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black hole mass (M
            BH) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (σ) and luminosity (L; the M-σ and M-L relations), based on 49 M
            BH measurements and 19 upper limits. Particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter (ϵ0) in both relations. We find log(M
            BH/M
            ☉) = α + βlog(σ/200 km s–1) with (α, β, ϵ0) = (8.12 ± 0.08, 4.24 ± 0.41, 0.44 ± 0.06) for all galaxies and (α, β, ϵ0) = (8.23 ± 0.08, 3.96 ± 0.42, 0.31 ± 0.06) for ellipticals. The results for ellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatter recovered for spirals is significantly larger. The scatter inferred reinforces the need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass function based on the M-σ relation, and further implies that there may be substantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the M-σ relation. We estimate the M-L relationship as log(M
            BH/M
            ☉) = α + βlog(LV
            /1011 L
            ☉,V
            ) of (α, β, ϵ0) = (8.95 ± 0.11, 1.11 ± 0.18, 0.38 ± 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. These results appear to be insensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and the distribution of intrinsic scatter. We show that culling the sample according to the resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations to larger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.}

	journal = {Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific},
	abstract = {We discuss two separate cross-correlation methdologies, the interpolation method of Gaskell and Sparkle and the discrete correlation function of Edelson and Krolik, that are commonly used to quantify the lags between continuum and emission-line flux variations in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We show that if similar assumptions are made to normalize the cross-correlation functions, the two methods are in good agreement for well-sampled AGN light curves. We also investigate the performance of cross-correlation methodology for less well-sampled data sets through Monte Carlo simulations that employ realistic models of the continuum behavior (based on well-observed Seyfert galaxies) and typical emission-line response times. We find that the interpolation method fairly accurately recovers the emission-line lags as the sampling is degraded (i.e., as the number of observed points is reduced). We find that for the cases investigated, the emission-line lags can be determined with reasonable accuracy even with mean sampling intervals as large as around two weeks.}
